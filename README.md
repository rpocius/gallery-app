# Responsive Image Gallery

## Description: 
A practice projects to build a responsive image gallery that displays a collection of images with a lightbox feature for viewing enlarged images.

## Requirements:

- Create a React-based UI with components for displaying a grid of images.
- Use a static set of images stored in your project, or fetch images from an external source like Unsplash or a similar API.
- Implement a lightbox feature that allows users to click on an image to view it in a larger format, with navigation controls to view other images in the gallery.
- Make the gallery responsive, adjusting the number of columns based on screen size.
- Bonus: Add a simple search or filter feature to find specific images by keyword or category.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
